driver model
   major/minor scheme
   drivers register themselves with the kernel
    major - points to the driver
    minor - points to the specific driver instance (1 per device)
driver/device types
   character  - as per the normal *nix meaning
   block      - ditto
   filesystem - for connecting filesystems
VFS layer
   prefix table mapping strings to major+minor
   /dev maps to devfs
   / maps to root filesystem
devfs
   drivers may register with devfs to provide a device node in /dev
