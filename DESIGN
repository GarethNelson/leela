driver model
   major/minor scheme
   drivers register themselves with the kernel
    major - points to the driver
    minor - points to the specific driver instance (1 per device)
VFS layer
   prefix table mapping strings to major+minor
   /dev maps to devfs
devfs
   drivers may register with devfs to provide a device node
